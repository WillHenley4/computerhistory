  <h1>History of Computers</h1>
  <h2>1. how it all started</h2>
  <p>In 1937, a scientist by the name of George Stiblitz created the "Model K"
Adder, this was just one of his components to his relay based model 1 complex
calculator, which he made in 1939. Speaking of the year 1939, a german engineer
by the name of Konrad Zuse made the Z2 computers which used the same relays as
George Stiblitz's calculator used. In 1941, 2 years after the Z2 computer was
invented, Konrad Zuse creates the Z3 computer which is a huge improvement from
the Z2 computer because the Z3 computer used 2,300 relays, could perform
floating point binary arithmetic, and had a 22-bit word length. Sadly, the Z3
computer was destroyed by a ally boming raid on Berlin in 1943. In the 1960's,
Zuse recreated the Z3 computer and put it in a museum in Munich, Germany. in
1948, 3 years after World War 2, 3 researchers from the University of Manchester
,Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Toothill, developed the "Baby" which
was a Small-Scale Experimental Machine. It was used to test new memory
Technology that Williams and Kilburn created before the "Baby". This technology
is known as the Williams Tube and it was the first memory technology to have
high-speed electronic random access memory for computers. Combining the "Baby"
and the Williams Tube, they created the first program which consisted of 17
instructions written by Kilburn. This program was ran on June 21st, 1948. That
is how computer technology started.</p>

<h2>2. Golden Age</h2>
<p>In the early 1960's, the number of computer users increased since computers
became more mainstream at the time. so, this led to experiments on timesharing
computer systems. Timesharing systems can support 100's of users by sharing the
computer with each user, this led to the development of CTSS. Programs created
for CTSS included RUNOFF, a text formatting utility. CTSS operated until 1973.
Tom Kilburn, a man who pioneered computer memory storage, directed a team at
University of Manchester and started on a project called an Atlas Computer. The
Atlas Computer used virtual memory to use storage capacity and switch rapidly
among multiple programs or users. This was a key requirement for timesharing.
In 1964, the CDC 6600 is introduced and it can perform up to 3 million
instructions per second. At the time it was the fastest supercomputer in the
world. The reason it was so fast was because of it's design. It used 10 small
computers which were known as peripheral processing units which were capable of
offloading the workload from the central processor.</p>

<h2>3. Modern Age</h2>
<p>In 1977, one of the first PCs was made by the company Commodore called the
Commodore PET. It used a MOS Technologies 6502 microprocessor running at 1 MHZ.
This computer was really popular with schools and with people who want a
computer at home. Commodore really gave way to the PC Industry and was really
popular through the 90's. now it is the year 2000, the beginning to the new
century, and computer technology has progressed a lot. In 2003, Apple makes the
PowerMac G5. the G5 was the first true 64 bit PC, It revolutionized how PCs look
today. In 2007, a big thing happened that would shape the future of computers
and phones. The first smartphone was created by Apple, known as the iphone. This
was huge and Apple has revolutionized phones. A year after the iphone is
released, Apple comes out with another banger, the macbook air. Apple used
technology that they used for their other computers and combined them to make
the macbook air. Apple really shined in the Modern Age. </p>

<h2>4. History of Gaming Consoles and Video Games</h2>
<p>I'm gonna add this one because I think it is important to know about the
history of gaming consoles and video games because it has something to do with
computer technology. The first video game to have ever been created was a little
game called Spacewar!. Spacewar! was created in 1962 by Steve Russel, Martin
Graetz, and Wayne Wiitanen. The game was inspired by E.E. Smith called Spacewar!
which was a series of sc-fi novels. That game pretty much invented gaming. In
1972, Pong was released. Pong became the most popular game and threw Spacewar!
out of the ring. Pong revolutionized the arcade industry and launched the modern
gaming era. In 1977, the pioneer of gaming consoles was invented by Atari called
"Atari 2600". Atari sold 20 million units throughout the 80's and by the end of
the 90's, 900 game titles had been made for the Atari 2600. In 1985, a new
company, Nintendo, comes out with a console called the NES. The NES was a total
success by the turn of the decade and a lot of game titles were made for it.  </p>

<h2>5. AI and Robots</h2>
<p>you can't talk about milestones in computer technology without talking about
AI and robots. The first instance of robots in history is a robot made in 1939
named Elektro. Elektro was made by Westinghouse and used relays like the ones
George Stiblitz and Konrad Zuse used to create their inventions. Elektro can
respond to the rythm of voice commands and can say wisecracks that were
prerecorded on 78 rpm records. The most impressive thing though is that Elektro
can move its arms and legs but really slowly. The funny thing is that it can
smoke cigs. In 1948, Norbert Weiner publishes a book called "Cybernetics". This
book was really important because it had a major influence on research into
artifical Intelligence and control systems. Cybernetics plays a really important
role in AI today. In my opinion, I don't like the future of AI now because I
think that scientists are trying to play God and that might not be good.</p>
